<h1>Musical Conway's Game of Life</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> is a cellular automaton developed by John Conway in 1970. This is a (wrapped-edges) JavaScript implementation of the game, where each living cell makes sound using Mozilla's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a>. The y-coordinate of the cell controls pitch, while the x-coordinate controls filter cutoff and panning. The number of living neighbors to a cell determines the Q-factor of the low-pass filter. An LFO controls detuning. All of this is handled by large arrays of nodes hooked up to the game board itself. Some parameters of the game are included at the start of the script.js file; these can be tweaked to change the sound and behavior of the game.
<br /> <br />
I created this page for a school project in my sophomore year of college. It was my first proper exposure to Javascript and HTML, so the implementation is somewhat buggy and inefficient. But, it's a neat project, so I've tried to patch the major issues so that I can still show it off! The audio seems to work best in <strong>Google Chrome</strong>.
<br /> <br />
<strong>To play:</strong> set up an initial state on the game board by clicking cells to toggle them alive/dead, then press the "Play" checkbox to toggle running the game. Alternatively, use the "Random Board" buttons or the Premade Patterns to populate the game board. The rules of the game are listed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">the Wikipedia page</a>; but, most of the fun comes from just setting up interesting shapes and seeing where they go. For more, check out <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page">LifeWiki</a> to see some of the crazy things people have come up with; my personal favorite is <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life">this functional Tetris implementation WITHIN Conway's Game of Life</a>.
